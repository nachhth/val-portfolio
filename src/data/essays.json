    "title": "A Postcolonial Study of Aboriginal Identity in Tara June Winch’s The Yield",
    "abstract": "This study aspires to explore the issue of Aboriginal identity in Tara June Winch’s novel The Yield(2019) from a postcolonial point of view. In order to fulfill this main goal, I will focus on four major aspects connected to Aboriginality that are particularly relevant in the novel: language and culture, history and traditions, the importance of returning home in Aboriginal literature and, last but not least, Indigenous peoples and their relationship with the land. The methodologies used to carry out this paper were a previous close reading analysis of The Yield, researching about Aboriginal culture, language and struggles, and studying the history of Australian Aboriginal communities in relation to their identities. After years of being subjected to a colonial empire, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia are still suffering the consequences of a system fueled by whitesupremacy and imperialism. Stories like The Yield, contribute to Australia’s First Nations being validated and accepted.",

    "title": "Places and Spaces: A Study of Intersectionality and Identity in Gabby Rivera’s Juliet Takes a Breath (2016)",
    "abstract": "One of the elements that influence the creation of someone’s identity is the spaces they inhabit. In a certain way, we are shaped by the places that we navigate in the course of our lives and transformed by the marks those places leave on us. Thus, the notion of a “fixed” identity is challenged by the reconfiguration of the parts that comprise the term in relation to the spaces we occupy in society. This essay aspires to explore the issue of identity in Gabby Rivera’s novel Juliet Takes a Breath (2016) by explaining how the concepts of ethnicity, sexuality and gender and intertwined. In order to do so, I will try to establish a relationship between the physical places mentioned in the book and the mental spaces Juliet, the protagonist, constructs during her journey of self-discovery. The methodologies used to carry out this study were a previous close reading analysis of Juliet Takes a Breath and researching about intersectional feminism theories and ideas in relation to gender, sexuality and ethnicity. There are three places in the novel where Juliet’s identity is deconstructed and reshaped: the Bronx, the place where she was born and raised, Portland, where she goes for the purpose of an internship, and Miami, the city where she spends time with her cousin. Each one of these places represent the study of a different layer in Juliet’s identity; while the Bronx is a space for questioning matters of ethnicity, in Portland she explores her relationship with gender roles and, in Miami, the protagonist learns to embrace her sexuality. These three places are the cornerstone of Juliet’s introspective discovery of her(self), as they contribute to forming her sense of space in connection to her identity.",
